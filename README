## Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the automation framework:

1. **Install Node.js**  
   Ensure you have the latest version of Node.js installed.  
   (Verified with **v21.6.2** at the time of development).

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Run the following command to install project dependencies: npm install

3. **Install TypeScripts**  
   If TypeScript is not already installed globally on your system, you can install it using: npm install -g typescript.
   Verified with Version 5.3.3.

4. **Environment Configuration**  
   Add a .env file to the root directory with the following value: BASEURL_MAGENTOAPP=https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com

## Installation Guide

Below is a list of scripts defined in package.json for running and managing tests:

    pretest: Compiles the TypeScript files into JavaScript (tsc --incremental -p tsconfig.json).
    test:headed: Runs all tests in headed mode (playwright test --headed).
    test:headless: Runs all tests in headless mode (playwright test --headless).
    test:uimode: Launches Playwright's UI mode for debugging and managing tests (playwright test --ui).
